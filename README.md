# What?

TubeFeed was created because I didn't like streaming YouTube while driving. Most of my YouTube feed can be used as only audio anyway. This doesn't do much without [myrmidon](http://github.com/brettof86/myrmidon).

# Usage

Once you download some items with myrmidon.

```
npm i --production
npm start
```

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/rss to see an rss feed of your myrmidon files.

Add this url to any podcast app (iTunes, Downcast, etc) I recommend Downcast.app.
